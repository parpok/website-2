# My website I guess

This time its a bit better

More content and etc

I picked Svelte because it had chiller vibe than react

Was it painful - yes but I feel the same about any web technology

So whatever

At least it runs on vercel which is painless to set up

## Style

I prefer minimal style for my website

No fireworks because I don't like dealing with CSS
